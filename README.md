# üß† Mental Health Analyzer from Text

An AI-powered web application that analyzes written text to detect potential signs of mental distress, built with HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit.

Note: The original trained model file was large and excluded due to GitHub file size limits.
The deployed Streamlit app demonstrates the final working version with the model hosted¬†externally.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In a world where many hesitate to discuss mental health openly, their written text often reflects their inner state. This project aims to build a tool that can analyze text from social media posts, chats, or journals to identify early signs of stress, anxiety, or depression, enabling timely support.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **NLP Analysis:** Utilizes a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to perform sentiment and emotional tone classification.
-   **Real-time Prediction:** Provides an immediate classification of the text into categories like "Potential Suicide post" or "Not a Suicide post".
-   **Confidence Score:** Displays the model's confidence in its prediction.
-   **Simple UI:** A clean and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for easy use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend & ML:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
-   **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers (DistilBERT)
-   **Web Framework:** Streamlit
-   **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud
